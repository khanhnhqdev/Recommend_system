# Recommend System
## I. Data:   
The dataset use in this code is movie len 100k
## II. Algorithms to implement in this project includes:
1. Content-base  
2. Collaborative filtering:  
    - Neiborhood base: user-user and item-item  
    - Model base:  
        + Collaborative Filtering Approach Based on Na√Øve Bayes Classifier  
        + Regression based: Matrix Factorization

## III. Evaluation:
The system is evaluated by three criteria: RMSE, MAP(mean average precision) and NDCG(normalized discounted cumulative gain).  
ll the results are recorded in output.txt file.  
## IV. Code:
To run code: 
```
python main.py
```
